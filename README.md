# Chi-Square-practice
Very simple chi-square test for independence example

For the eighth course in my master's program, one of the assignments was to create an audio file of a presentation based on a slide deck we had to critique the week before. The slide we critiqued was jam-packed with statistical concepts. We could modify that any way we wanted for the audio presentation. We didn't have to create new slides; we just had to make the audio as if we were presenting new slides, and keep it to around 10 minutes.

I chose to narrow the topic to key points in hypothesis testing, while using the chi-square test for independence as an example. The accompanying notebook is the toy dataset I made specifically for the chi-square test and the test itself.
